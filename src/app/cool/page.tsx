      Hii, I&apos;m Alex! Something cool about me is that I&apos;m part of Infinite Harmony, the co-ed a capella club at GT. 
      We have a concert each semester, and this February, we&apos;ll be performing at the International Championship 
      of Collegiate A Cappella! Check us out at https://www.gtinfiniteharmony.com/.
